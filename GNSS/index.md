## Notes

**GNSS:** Global Navigation Satellite System

Different country have there own GNSS:

1. GPS (Global Positining System) by USA in 1973
2. GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System) by Russia
3. BeiDou by China
4. IRNSS (Indial Regional Navigation Satellite System) by India **etc ...**

**Dead Reckoning:** The technique of estimating one's current position based on a previously determined one.

**Doppler:** The change in frequency of wave caused by movement of source relative to its observer.

**Theoretical Doppler:** The expected Doppler frequency based on satellite's motion relative to the receiver.

**Apparent Doppler:** Same as Theoretical Doppler of satellite above, with clock drift correction added.

**Instantaneous Carrier:** The Doppler frequency measured at the receiver, at that **epoch** (i.e. specific point in time).

In some cases it is necessary to augment GNSS technology with other system to meet the performance requirements of a particular application.

Each GNNS employs a constellation of satellites, which broadcasts signals that are then processed by GNNS receivers to determine location, speed, and time for the user anywhere within range of the satellites.

Minimum 3 satellites are necessary to determine location.
