Data:
1. Camera images:
    - 1024x1024 resolution
    - 20 Hz
2. IMU: accelerations and angular velocities on 3 axes
    - 200 Hz

Note: cameras and IMU sensors are timesynchronized in hardware

For trajectory evaluation
  - Accurate pose ground truth from a motion capture system at high frequency (120 Hz) at the **start and end of the sequences**.
