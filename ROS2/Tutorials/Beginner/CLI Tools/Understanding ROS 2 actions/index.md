# Understanding ROS 2 actions

- Actions are one of the communication types in ROS 2 and are intended for long running tasks.
- They consist of three parts: a **goal**, **feedback**, and a **result**.
- Actions are built on topics and services.
- Their functionality is similar to services, except actions can be canceled.
